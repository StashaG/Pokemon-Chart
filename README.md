Hi Peeps!

Stacey Here! I'm a huge foodie and I am currenlty obsessed with Pho, but I also love mexican food. Chips and Salsa and Quac is my fav snack and don't let me forget pizza (authentic brick oven pizza with a flavorful marinara sauce). I am learning HTML, CSS, and JS on Udemy.com. 

I am taking the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. I am learning so much!! And I am excited to create my own website portfolio.

I used to be a Pokemon fan when I was young and loved Pikachu.
